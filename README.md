# Agriot_sense
 Smart farming solution for fertiliser management to detect crop diseases and to increase crop yield with water control tools for all kind of farms through patented IoT and AI algorithm, for smart and sustainable agriculture and crops. We are first Soil NPK Sensor solution for vertical and agricultural farms. We have two core product- Hardware (IoT) and Software (AI Software). We are developing the world’s first IoT + AI interface technology for the farmers, implemented with the Nano Satellite Image mapping. We are making agriculture more precise through Nano satellite field images for big farms with accurate precision farming through smart ground sensors for small farms. Also, our inhouse smart soil sensing coverage and gives accurate data surveillance under and above soil. We are making world’s first smart soil sensor for NPK detection using our patent technology that measure more than 15-20 parameters from ground sensors( including NPK fertilizers) detection and giving solution and prediction to farmers for better decision making to get best crop yield and save money in farms.
